## Course information, syllabus, logistics and questions 
> 12th Jan 2026

### Course Prerequisite
- Python (beginner experience)
- Using CLI (Like Git, docker)
- SQL (exposure)
- Data Engineering experience (NOT REQUIRED)

### Course Resources
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)
- [Project Details](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/projects)
- [Cohort of 2026](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/cohorts/2026) (Will have homework information and live stream recordings which are specific for this cohort)

### Course Logistics
> Details of the course logistic can be found on the [main website](https://datatalks.club/docs/courses/data-engineering-zoomcamp/)

- The course will use the [New York Taxi Dataset](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)


### Questions and Answers

- AI assistance is fine (reccomended) as long as you understand the things being done (each line of code).
- Career change to DE is possible from non-CS background. Do multiple projects (projects are the main goal) but dont wait for applying to jobs.
- Apache Airflow can be used in place of Kestra for orchestration, but note that no support will be provided for course outside of the course reccomended.
- You can remake GCP accounts to get free credits extension.
- Learn the concepts and keep upskilling as shifts in technologies happen all the time in DE.
- **ITS GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO LAND A JOB IN DATA ENGINEERING WITHOUT ANY PRIOR DATA ROLE/ SOFTWARE ENGINEERING EXPERIENCE (Software Engineering has more openings than Data Engineering and Data Engineering is more catered towards already experienced engineers)**
- **Back-End development** is quite useful for data engineering but so are fields like data science and analyst.
- General software engineering will always have more demands as compared to any other specialized form of engineering i.e. (data engineering, ML engineering)
- How to select a good final project? [datasets](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/dataset.md), also brain storm with AI if required. But main thing to keep in mind is completing the project not how fancy it is.
- Job search : apply, attend interviews and accept repeating the interviews
- How to get DE position as a freshers: Focus on project, but make sure you choose a domain and research the company you will be applying to, ensure MAKING PROJECT STAYS THE MAIN GOAL. Projects is a way to gain attention and showcase your skills. (2 to 3 projects are optimal)
- Linux is better for this course.
- The project can be done week by week i.e. from the start of the course.
- Data engineers are typically experienced engineers, i.e. either from data science back ground or software engineerings. Junior data engineers are very rare,  not impossible.
- GCP will be used in this course.
- General software engineering (back end) will be more useful for pivoting into data engineering.
- Dont jump around to different domains i.e. Data Engineering, ML Engineering, AI Engineering. Double down on your strengths.
- In some cases there should be a plan B i.e. you  might not get roles in data engineering so you might need to find roles in data science, data analyst and analytics engineering.
